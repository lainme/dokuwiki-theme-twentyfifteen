Twenty Fifteen Template for DokuWiki by lainme <lainme993@gmail.com>, based on
the Twenty Fifteen Theme for WordPress by WordPress.org & Automattic.com

== Information ==

1. RTL

    RTL is supported by this template, but not fully checked.

2. IE compatibility

    Not tested, may not work properly for IE<9.

3. Include hooks

    Only 'meta.html' will be included.

4. Comments styling

    Since I am using Disqus, styling for Discussion plugin or other comments plugin
    is not considered. In short, comments styling is not included.

5. Closer look & feel with the original theme

    By default, entries don't have footer information (publish date, author,
    comments count, etc) and show within one single <article> block, due to the
    different mechanism of WordPress and Dokuwiki. However, the relavent styling is
    retained, so it's possible to get it back.

    If you are using miniblog, try the 'twentyfifteen' branch.

    If you are using BlogTNG, create 'list.php' tpl file that produces the
    following HTML for a single entry in blog lists,

    <article class="entry">
        <header class="entry-header">
            <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="[POST-URL]">[POST-TITLE]</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="entry-content">
            [POST-CONTENT-WITHOUT-TITLE]
        </div>
        <footer class="entry-footer">
            <span class="entry-date">[POST-DATE]</span>
            <span class="entry-catagory">[POST-CATEGORY]</span>
            <span class="entry-tag">[POST-TAG]</span>
            <span class="entry-author">[POST-AUTHOR]</span>
            <span class="entry-comment">[POST-COMMENTS-COUNT]</span>
       </footer>
    </article>

    and create 'entry.php' tpl file that produces the following HTML for individual
    entry,

    <article class="entry">
        <div class="entry-content">
            [POST-CONTENT-WITH-TITLE]
        </div>
        <footer class="entry-footer">
            <span class="entry-date">[POST-DATE]</span>
            <span class="entry-catagory">[POST-CATEGORY]</span>
            <span class="entry-tag">[POST-TAG]</span>
            <span class="entry-author">[POST-AUTHOR]</span>
            <span class="entry-comment">[POST-COMMENTS-COUNT]</span>
       </footer>
    </article>

    Then add the following code to your custom css file,

    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry,
    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry-content {
        margin-right: 0 !important;
        margin-bottom: 0 !important;
        padding: 0 !important;
        border: 0 !important;
        box-shadow: none !important;
    }

    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry {
        background-color: @ini_background_site;
        margin-left: 1px !important;
    }

    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry-content {
        margin-top: 0 !important;
        margin-left: 0 !important;
    }

    If you are using other plugins, check if the plugin supports tpl or modify the
    code by yourself.
