Twenty Fifteen Template for DokuWiki by lainme <lainme993@gmail.com>, based on
the Twenty Fifteen Theme for WordPress by WordPress.org & Automattic.com

== Information ==

1. RTL

    RTL is supported by this template, but not fully checked.

2. IE compatibility

    Not tested, may not work properly for IE<9.

3. Include hooks

    Only 'meta.html' will be included.

4. Comments styling

    Since I am using Disqus, styling for Discussion plugin or other comments plugin
    is not considered. In short, comments styling is not included.

5. Closer look & feel with the original theme

    By default, entries don't have footer information (publish date, author,
    comments count, etc) and show within one single <article> block, due to the
    different mechanism of WordPress and Dokuwiki. However, the relavent styling is
    retained, so it's possible to get it back.

    If you are using miniblog, use syntax '<miniblog twentyfifteen>' instead.

    If you are using BlogTNG, create 'list.php' tpl file that produces the
    following HTML for a single entry in blog lists,

    <article class="entry">
        <header class="entry-header">
            <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="[POST-URL]">[POST-TITLE]</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="entry-content">
            [POST-CONTENT-WITHOUT-TITLE]
        </div>
        <footer class="entry-footer">
            <span class="entry-date">[POST-DATE]</span>
            <span class="entry-catagory">[POST-CATEGORY]</span>
            <span class="entry-tag">[POST-TAG]</span>
            <span class="entry-author">[POST-AUTHOR]</span>
            <span class="entry-comment">[POST-COMMENTS-COUNT]</span>
       </footer>
    </article>

    and create 'entry.php' tpl file that produces the following HTML for individual
    entry,

    <article class="entry">
        <div class="entry-content">
            [POST-CONTENT-WITH-TITLE]
        </div>
        <footer class="entry-footer">
            <span class="entry-date">[POST-DATE]</span>
            <span class="entry-catagory">[POST-CATEGORY]</span>
            <span class="entry-tag">[POST-TAG]</span>
            <span class="entry-author">[POST-AUTHOR]</span>
            <span class="entry-comment">[POST-COMMENTS-COUNT]</span>
       </footer>
    </article>

    Then add the following code to your custom css file,

    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry,
    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry-content {
        margin-right: 0 !important;
        margin-bottom: 0 !important;
        padding: 0 !important;
        border: 0 !important;
        box-shadow: none !important;
    }

    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry {
        background-color: @ini_background_site;
        margin-left: 1px !important;
    }

    .mode_show #twentyfifteen__entry-content {
        margin-top: 0 !important;
        margin-left: 0 !important;
    }

    If you are using other plugins, check if the plugin supports tpl or modify the
    code by yourself.
